This code is based on the code from this blog posting:

  http://www.letsyouandhimfight.com/2010/07/14/cl-bcrypt-a-first-attempt/

I packaged it up with an .asd file, frobbed the API, and added some
comments.

* Installing

Since this code is just a thin wrapper around a C bcrypt library
you'll need one of those installed on your system. (Note that the
bcrypt package available on Ubuntu and Debian does not provide this
libraryâ€”it is a file encryption program that uses the Blowfish
algorithm.) The easiest solution is probably to get the Openwall
bcrypt from http://www.openwall.com/crypt/.

 - Extract it in a directory of your choice, and run make.

 - Now create a shared library:

      gcc -shared -W1,-soname,libbcrypt.so.1 -o libbcrypt.so.1.0.4 crypt_blowfish.o x86.o

   (of course, replace 1 and 1.0.4 with the correct version numbers).

Place the resulting libbcrypt.so.1.0.4 somewhere where Lisp can find
it. (~/lib will work or the cffi:*foreign-library-directories*
variable may be useful here.)
